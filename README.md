In Search of Agile Time Series Database
=======

Time series data is everywhere. There are a lot of databases claim to be good time series database (TSDB). Which of them is good for your use case? This book is about my quest on searching for a "agile" time series database.

There is another title for this book: "Why Elasticsearch is awesome for time series data from inside out" or "What traditional database has tried but still not quite nailed it". We will go through what is required for a time series database, what have tried before, why Elasticsearch is so great, and how can be use it to make our job better.
